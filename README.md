## Executive summary
Fitness trackers allow to collect large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. In this project, we analze data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information about data is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).  
The report describes the process of builting predicting model, using provided data. Firstly, we clean dataset in order to remove columns which could not be predictors. Secondly, we divide data set into train and data datasets. Finally, we apply Random Forest model and get ver high acuracy model.Our out-sample error is 0.0008 and we get 100% accuracy on test dataset which containcs 20 obsrvations.
